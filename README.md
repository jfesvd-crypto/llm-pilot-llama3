## About the Project

**Contrast Calculus** is a new mathematical framework where the fundamental entities are relations ("contrasts") rather than objects. The goal of the project is to reformulate the foundations of mathematics in such a way that relations are primary and constitute the main building blocks of structures and operations.

## From Sketch to Code

The project's vision is to enable intuitive work with abstract mathematicsâ€”exactly as shown in the image above. Thanks to "Contrast Calculus," it's possible to translate visual, hand-drawn diagrams into verifiable and functional code. The framework is being created with the idea that anyone can experiment with contrasts without the need for tedious formalization of objects.

## Current Status

The project is in an active research phase. A working prototype in Python already exists, and work is currently underway on the formal specification and verification of the framework's basic assumptions. If you want to follow the progress or join the team, feel free to get in touch!
