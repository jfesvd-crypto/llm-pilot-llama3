\begin{abstract}
We introduce Contrast Calculus, a relations-first, diagrammatic framework that realizes pointed fusion categories in an intuitive yet rigorous form. The primitives of the calculus are contrasts—typed relational generators—whose monoidal composition is governed by controlled nonassociativity via a group 3-cocycle. We axiomatize duality and loop evaluation through a “Zorro’s Law” principle that fixes a spherical structure, yielding path-independent diagrammatic evaluation. Our main results are twofold: (i) a classification theorem showing that, for a finite group G and a 3-cocycle $\omega$, the calculus presents the pointed fusion category $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$; and (ii) a coherence theorem guaranteeing a consistent spherical structure. We complement these results with a numerically verified Python implementation for $G=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, where all coherence conditions, including the pentagon and snake identities, have been validated by property-based testing. This work provides a practical bridge from hand-drawn diagrams to executable code, opening a relations-first perspective on tensor categories with potential applications to TQFT and quantum information.

\section{Introduction}
Classical mathematics often treats objects as primary and relations as derivative. Yet insights from quantum theory and category theory suggest that a relations-first stance can yield a more faithful and economical account of structure. We pursue this perspective by introducing Contrast Calculus: a diagrammatic, relations-first axiomatic framework in which differences (“contrasts”) are the sole primitives and composition is governed locally. Two design choices are central. First, we incorporate controlled nonassociativity at the axiomatic level via a normalized 3-cocycle $\omega$, reflecting the classification of pointed fusion categories by $H^3(G, U(1))$. Second, we reinterpret duality and loop evaluation through a principle we call Zorro’s Law, which canonically selects a pivotal—and in fact spherical—structure, ensuring path-independent diagrammatic evaluation.

Our main results are twofold. First, for any finite group G, the calculus is tensor equivalent to the pointed fusion category $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$ (Theorem A). Second, the axioms entail a coherent spherical structure, guaranteeing that the evaluation of any closed planar diagram is well-defined and path independent (Theorem B). We substantiate these claims with an executable model for $G=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, using property-based testing to verify all coherence conditions. By bridging hand-drawn diagrams with verifiable code, Contrast Calculus provides an accessible language for higher categorical structures, with potential applications in TQFT, quantum information, and the study of symmetry and anomaly.

\section{Preliminaries and Related Work}
We assume basic familiarity with monoidal categories, following Mac Lane’s classic account \cite{MacLane1998}. Our work is situated within the field of **fusion categories**—rigid, semisimple tensor categories with finitely many simple objects; a comprehensive treatment can be found in the monograph by Etingof, Gelaki, Nikshych, and Ostrik \cite{EGNO2015}. These structures serve as algebraic models for a wide range of physical symmetries.

The central algebraic object in our framework is a **group 3-cocycle** $\omega \in Z^3(G, U(1))$, where G is a finite group. Such cocycles classify anomalies in (2+1)-dimensional topological gauge theories, as established by Dijkgraaf and Witten \cite{DijkgraafWitten1990}, and ensure the coherent non-associativity of the monoidal product via the Mac Lane pentagon identity. Our calculus generates a significant class of fusion categories known as **pointed fusion categories**, denoted $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$. In these, the simple objects are indexed by elements of G, and their associativity is “twisted” by the cocycle $\omega$.

Our diagrammatic formalism extends the graphical calculus of Joyal and Street \cite{JoyalStreet1993}. The “Zorro’s Law” axiom explicitly enforces a **spherical structure**—a notion rigorously developed by Barrett and Westbury \cite{BarrettWestbury1999}—which guarantees that closed diagrams admit well-defined, path-independent evaluations.

\section{The Axiomatic Framework of Contrast Calculus}
The foundation of Contrast Calculus is a single-object, diagrammatic calculus parameterized by a pair (S, $\Delta$), where $\Delta$ is identified with the elements of a finite group G, and S $\subseteq \C^\times$ is an abelian multiplicative group of scalars with S $\cong \mathrm{End}(\iotaunit)$.

\subsection{A0-A7: The Core Axioms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{A0}] \textbf{Primitives:} $\Delta \cong G$ indexes the simple, invertible labels; S provides scalars.
    \item[\textbf{A1}] \textbf{Duality:} An involution $(-)^\perp: \Delta \to \Delta$ with $(x^\perp)^\perp = x$ and $(x \tens y)^\perp = y^\perp \tens x^\perp$.
    \item[\textbf{A2}] \textbf{Unit:} A unit $\iotaunit \in \Delta$ such that $x \tens \iotaunit = \iotaunit \tens x = x$.
    \item[\textbf{A3}] \textbf{Tensor:} A total tensor product $\tens: \Delta \times \Delta \to \Delta$ corresponds to the group product in G.
    \item[\textbf{A4}] \textbf{Associator:} For any $x,y,z \in \Delta$, there is a scalar $a(x,y,z) \in S$ such that $(x \tens y) \tens z = a(x,y,z) \cdot (x \tens (y \tens z))$. The function $a: G^3 \to S$ is a normalized 3-cocycle.
    \item[\textbf{A5}] \textbf{Loop Evaluation:} Every closed diagram D has a well-defined scalar evaluation $\langle D \rangle \in S$.
    \item[\textbf{A6}] \textbf{Zorro’s Law / Spherical Structure:} The calculus is rigid and spherical. There are evaluation/coevaluation morphisms satisfying the snake identities, and simple loops are normalized by $\langle x \tens x^\perp \rangle = 1$.
    \item[\textbf{A7}] \textbf{Centrality of Scalars:} Scalars S $\cong \mathrm{End}(\iotaunit)$ are central and slide freely across diagrams.
\end{itemize}

\section{Main Results}
\subsection{Theorem A: Classification}
Every model of Contrast Calculus satisfying A0–A7 for a finite group G and a normalized 3-cocycle $\omega \in Z^3(G, U(1))$ is tensor equivalent to the pointed fusion category $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$ over $\C$.

\subsection{Theorem B: Spherical Coherence}
Axioms A1, A2, and A6 equip the calculus with a consistent spherical structure. Consequently, the evaluation of any closed planar diagram is well-defined and independent of the chosen reduction path.

\section{A Computational Model: The $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ Case Study}
We substantiated the framework with a Python implementation for the Klein four-group $G=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. The model implements the group structure, a nontrivial normalized 3-cocycle, and diagrammatic reduction rules. All coherence conditions were verified using the Hypothesis library for property-based testing. Reproducible code is available at \href{https://github.com/jfesvd-crypto/llm-pilot-llama3}{github.com/jfesvd-crypto/llm-pilot-llama3}.

\section{Future Work — Four Directions}
The framework presented here is a foundation for several research directions: Higher Coherence (the H$^4$ anomaly), Richer Algebraic Structures (2-groups), Braiding and Quantum Computation, and The Axiomatic Trace (Shadows).

\section{Conclusion}
We introduced Contrast Calculus, a relations-first framework that provides an intuitive yet rigorous language for pointed fusion categories. We specified its axioms, proved its identification with $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$, and validated coherence through an executable model. By connecting hand-drawn diagrams to verifiable code, Contrast Calculus offers an accessible perspective on higher categorical structures with applications to TQFT and quantum information.
