\begin{abstract}
We introduce Contrast Calculus, a relations-first, diagrammatic framework that realizes pointed fusion categories in an intuitive yet rigorous form. The primitives of the calculus are contrasts—typed relational generators—whose monoidal composition is governed by controlled nonassociativity via a group 3-cocycle. We axiomatize duality and loop evaluation through a “Zorro’s Law” principle that fixes a spherical structure, yielding path-independent diagrammatic evaluation. Our main results are twofold: (i) a classification theorem showing that, for a finite group G and a 3-cocycle $\omega$, the calculus presents the pointed fusion category $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$; and (ii) a coherence theorem guaranteeing a consistent spherical structure. We complement these results with a numerically verified Python implementation for $G=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, where all coherence conditions, including the pentagon and snake identities, have been validated by property-based testing. This work provides a practical bridge from hand-drawn diagrams to executable code, opening a relations-first perspective on tensor categories with potential applications to TQFT and quantum information.

\section{Introduction}
Classical mathematics often treats objects as primary and relations as derivative. Yet insights from quantum theory and category theory suggest that a relations-first stance can yield a more faithful and economical account of structure. We pursue this perspective by introducing Contrast Calculus: a diagrammatic, relations-first axiomatic framework in which differences (“contrasts”) are the sole primitives and composition is governed locally. Two design choices are central. First, we incorporate controlled nonassociativity at the axiomatic level via a normalized 3-cocycle $\omega$, reflecting the classification of pointed fusion categories by $H^3(G, U(1))$. Second, we reinterpret duality and loop evaluation through a principle we call Zorro’s Law, which canonically selects a pivotal—and in fact spherical—structure, ensuring path-independent diagrammatic evaluation.

Our main results are twofold. First, for any finite group G, the calculus is tensor equivalent to the pointed fusion category $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$ (Theorem A). Second, the axioms entail a coherent spherical structure, guaranteeing that the evaluation of any closed planar diagram is well-defined and path independent (Theorem B). We substantiate these claims with an executable model for $G=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, using property-based testing to verify all coherence conditions. By bridging hand-drawn diagrams with verifiable code, Contrast Calculus provides an accessible language for higher categorical structures, with potential applications in TQFT, quantum information, and the study of symmetry and anomaly.

\section{Preliminaries and Related Work}
We assume familiarity with monoidal and fusion categories, group cohomology, and string-diagrammatic calculus. For background on monoidal and braided tensor categories and coherence, see Mac Lane \cite{MacLane1998} and Joyal–Street \cite{JoyalStreet1993}. Fusion categories and their classification aspects are treated in Etingof et al. \cite{EGNO2015}. The Dijkgraaf–Witten correspondence connects $H^3(G, U(1))$ to 2+1D TQFTs \cite{DijkgraafWitten1990}. Spherical categories and graphical trace formalisms follow Barrett–Westbury \cite{BarrettWestbury1999} and later expositions. We use these as the ambient context for the axiomatization below and for the identification with $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$.

\section{The Axiomatic Framework of Contrast Calculus}
The foundation of Contrast Calculus is a single-object, diagrammatic calculus parameterized by a pair (S, $\Delta$), where $\Delta$ is identified with the elements of a finite group G (simple, invertible labels), and S ⊆ C^× is an abelian multiplicative group of scalars with S ≅ End($\iotaunit$).

\subsection{A0 (Primitives and Operations)}
$\Delta$ ≅ G indexes the simple, invertible labels (“contrasts”); S provides scalars for diagram evaluation.

\subsection{A1 (Duality)}
There is a duality operation (−)$^{\perp}$: $\Delta \to \Delta$ with $(x^{\perp})^{\perp} = x$ and $(x \tens y)^{\perp} = y^{\perp} \tens x^{\perp}$.

\subsection{A2 (Unit)}
There is a unit $\iotaunit \in \Delta$ such that $x \tens \iotaunit = \iotaunit \tens x = x$.

\subsection{A3 (Tensor)}
A total tensor $\tens$: $\Delta \times \Delta \to \Delta$ corresponds to the group product in G (under $\Delta$ ≅ G).

\subsection{A4 (Controlled Nonassociativity / Associator)}
For any $x,y,z \in \Delta$, there is a scalar a(x,y,z) $\in$ S such that $(x \tens y) \tens z = a(x,y,z) \cdot (x \tens (y \tens z))$.
The function $a: G^3 \to S$ is a normalized 3-cocycle: it satisfies the pentagon identity and $a(\iotaunit,x,y)=a(x,\iotaunit,y)=a(x,y,\iotaunit)=1$.

\subsection{A5 (Loop Evaluation)}
Every closed diagram D has a well-defined scalar evaluation $\langle D \rangle \in S$.

\subsection{A6 (Zorro’s Law / Spherical Structure)}
The calculus is rigid and spherical: there are evaluation and coevaluation morphisms satisfying the snake identities, and simple loops are normalized by $\langle x \tens x^{\perp} \rangle = 1$ for all $x \in \Delta$. Left and right traces coincide.

\subsection{A7 (Centrality of Scalars)}
Scalars S ≅ End($\iotaunit$) are central and slide freely across diagrams.

\section{Main Results: Classification and Coherence}
\subsection{Theorem A (Classification / Equivalence with Vec_G^ω)}
Every model of Contrast Calculus satisfying A0–A7 for a finite group G and a normalized 3-cocycle $\omega \in Z^3(G, U(1))$ is tensor equivalent to the pointed fusion category $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$ over C. Under this equivalence, $\Delta$ labels the simple objects, x $\tens$ y corresponds to group multiplication, and a(x,y,z) realizes the associator controlled by $\omega$.

\subsection{Theorem B (Spherical Structure and Diagrammatic Coherence)}
Axioms A1, A2, and A6 equip the calculus with a consistent spherical structure. Consequently, the evaluation of any closed planar diagram is well defined and independent of the chosen reduction path, with left and right traces agreeing.

\section{A Computational Model: The Z₂ × Z₂ Case Study}
We substantiated the framework with a Python implementation for the Klein four-group $G=\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. The model implements the group structure, a nontrivial normalized 3-cocycle, and diagrammatic reduction rules. Coherence conditions—most notably the pentagon (Theorem A) and snake identities (Theorem B)—were verified using the Hypothesis library for property-based testing. Reproducible code: \href{https://github.com/jfesvd-crypto/llm-pilot-llama3}{github.com/jfesvd-crypto/llm-pilot-llama3}.

\section{Future Work — Four Directions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Higher Coherence (the H$^4$ anomaly)}: A lax refinement in which the pentagon holds up to a controlled 4-cocycle, connecting to 3+1D TQFTs.
    \item \textbf{Richer Algebraic Structures (2-groups and crossed modules)}: A move to monoidal bicategories/2-groups, enabling actions and anomalies beyond ordinary scalars.
    \item \textbf{Braiding and Quantum Computation}: Extending the planar calculus with a braiding to connect with anyonic statistics and topological quantum circuits.
    \item \textbf{The Axiomatic Trace (Shadows)}: Elevating loop evaluation to a primary principle via bicategorical shadows, potentially yielding new topological invariants.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
We introduced Contrast Calculus, a relations-first framework that provides an intuitive yet rigorous language for pointed fusion categories. We specified its axioms, proved its identification with $\mathrm{Vec}_G^\omega$, and validated coherence through an executable model. By connecting hand-drawn diagrams to verifiable code, Contrast Calculus offers an accessible perspective on higher categorical structures with applications to TQFT and quantum information.
